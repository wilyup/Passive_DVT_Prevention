# Passive DVT Prevention: 
## Abstract:
## Background Information:
Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious situation where a blood clot forms within the deep veins. DVT typically occurs within the thigh or lower leg; however, they can develop in other reigons of the body. DVT itself is not usually fatal, but can cause pulmonary embolism which is a blood clot in the lungs that often is fatal. The two types of existing treatments are active and passive DVT care. Active DVT care involves the patient repeating a movement to break down the blood clot. Passive care involves the usage of devices to push the blood clot up the leg. Often times both active and passive care are used on a patient, in addition to anticoagulant drugs.

## Project Overview:
Our project focuses on designing a medical class II Passive DVT Prevention Device. This device will use 10 - 12 bladders to stimulate blood flow within the three calve muscles depicted below. The bladders will be housed in a cuff manufactured out of Gore-Tex likely. The device will be driven by an embedded system to inflate and deflate the bladders sequentially up the leg similar to someone rolling a rolling pin up the back of the calve. This design differs from other sequential cuffs on the market in that this one will use many small bladders to create many small, smooth movements up the calve. The device will offer three different variable pressures and a timer that can be set to cause the device to trigger the compression sequence on time intervals varying from about 5 - 20 minutes. In addition, the device will be portable and battery powered.

## Project Status:
This project is still in the early scoping phases, but there will be more information to come as the project scope is more clearly defined and software, hardware, and material solutions are procured.
