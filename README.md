# Passive DVT Prevention: 
## Abstract:
## Background Information:
Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a serious situation where a blood clot forms within the deep veins. DVT typically occurs within the thigh or lower leg; however, they can develop in other reigons of the body. DVT itself is not usually fatal, but can cause pulmonary embolism which is a blood clot in the lungs that often is fatal. The two types of existing treatments are active and passive DVT care. Active DVT care involves the patient repeating a movement to break down the blood clot. Passive care involves the usage of devices to push the blood clot up the leg. Often times both active and passive care are used on a patient, in addition to anticoagulant drugs.
